Hello friends,

This is logic speaking here....

You know, companies pay for someone to develop such an app and deploy it
into production all on their own.

This is a simple un-paid "exercise" that does NOT guarantee myself, or 
others, the job that we are seeking, and it takes away time to have 
conversations with other potential employers.

I hate to say it that way, but it is true.


The other day, I filled out a one sheet census checkbox questionaire, 
mailed it back in, and they paid me $12.  Twelve dollars, that's right. 

And it didn't take any expertise whatsoever.

As well intentioned as this exercise is, it is not mutually beneficial.

A conversation between ourselves with my proving myself and skillsets 
while we sit at the same side of the table, so to speak, would
be much more effective to gain the talent you require.
