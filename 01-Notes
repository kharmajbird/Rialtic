First of all, this project is not complete, but in the spirit of release
early, release often, I have chosen to share my progress and thoughts thus far.

Instead of basing my work on the pretty well advanced submission on 
another branch of this repo.  That wouldn't be right.

I have a brief python app, dockerized, and running under the flask framework
that, once the container is spun up, can be reached at:

http://localhost/input?DOB=082471&first=James&last=Lewis

Beware, there is no sort of error checking or linting, but if you give the app the 
right params, it will work.  There may be dragons, though...

Linkerd is giving me some install issues, since I haven't worked with this piece of 
tech before, it is taking some time to figure it out, so I can proceed with the 
kubernetes and Terraform pieces.

To be continued....
